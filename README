    Some exceptions:

    Perl 5.8

      [@Git] does not support Perl 5.8, so it is not a prereq there, and it
      isn't included in the bundle. As a result releasing from Perl 5.8 is
      not allowed.

    MSWin32

      Installing [@Git] on MSWin32 is a pain so it is also not a prereq on
      that platform, isn't used and as a result releasing from MSWin32 is
      not allowed.

OPTIONS

 installer

    Specify an alternative to [MakeMaker] ([ModuleBuild],
    [ModuleBuildTiny], or [ModuleBuildDatabase] for example).

    If installer is Alien, then any options with the alien_ prefix will be
    passed to Alien (minus the alien_ prefix).

    If installer is ModuleBuild, then any options with the mb_ prefix will
    be passed to ModuleBuild (including the mb_ prefix).

    If you have a inc/My/ModuleBuild.pm file in your dist, then this plugin
    bundle will assume installer is ModuleBuild and mb_class =
    My::ModuleBuild.

 readme_from

    Which file to pull from for the Readme (must be POD format). If not
    specified, then the main module will be used.

 release_tests

    If set to true, then include release tests when building.

 release_tests_skip

    Passed into the Author::Plicease::Tests if release_tests is true.

 travis_status

    if set to true, then include a link to the travis build page in the
    readme.

 mb_class

    if builder = ModuleBuild, this is the mb_class passed into the
    [ModuleBuild] plugin.
